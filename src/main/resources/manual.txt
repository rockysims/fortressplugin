=======
Generator Rune

The generator rune
is a 3x2x1 pattern of
blocks that can burn
glowstone to make any
adjacent structure
unbreakable.

Structure can be built
of cobble and/or any
blocks in generator's
fuel chest.
=======
Rune Pattern

R: redstone dust
G: gold block
C: chest
D: diamond block
I: iron block

Top layer:    RGC
Bottom layer: IDI

Place sign on front of
gold block to activate.
=======
Placing Generator

Place in the world (not
the crafting table) the
six block rune pattern
(see page 3).

Then place a blank
sign on the front or
back of the gold block.
Text will appear on the
sign.
=======
Redstone

When not powered by
redstone, generator
pauses fuel usage and
makes structures
breakable again.

Cycle power to spread
protection to newly
placed blocks.
=======
Security

Right click fortress
wall with empty hand.
Bedrock wave will pass
over protected blocks.

Particle Meanings:
Heart: Inside
Fire: Outside
Smoke: Disabled
=======
Doors

Protected doors open
only for white listed
players (right click).

Place a sign on block
above door to white
list player(s).

If door has no white
list signs, it looks for
signs on rune's base.
=======
Directives

Certain items can be
placed in generator's
fuel chest to enable
special behaviors.

Blaze Rod:
Fast un/protection
=======
/stuck

If you get stuck, you
can type /stuck to
teleport to nearby
after a delay.
=======
If a door leads from
outside the fortress
to inside, the whitelist
sign must be inside.

If you're not sure
what's inside, see
Security (page 6).
=======
Trapdoor whitelist
signs must be *in* one
of the six adjacent
blocks.

Unlike whitelist signs
for normal doors
which must be *in* the
block above the door
or one of the six
blocks adjacent to it.
=======
Signs adjacent to
whitelist signs are also
considered whitelist
signs (recursive).

Whitelist signs can
contain one name per
line or a comma
separated list of
names. If comma
separated, a name can
span multiple lines.
=======
No bedrock wave is
shown when opening
a door with right click
even if hand is empty.

Got feedback for me?
I'd be glad to hear it.
