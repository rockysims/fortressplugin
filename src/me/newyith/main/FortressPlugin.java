// --- MVP ---

//TODO: change '/stuck' to '/fort stuck' (done) and make delay configurable (not done)
//TODO: increase generation range (64? at least some). make range configurable
//	maybe change to block limit instead? feels like a better solution... however:
//		issue is /fort stuck can't tell if your close enough to pay attention to and same with getNearbyRunes for claim checking
//TODO: make signs on generator's base a global white list

//TODO: save data using jackson instead of config (so config won't get too big to open)
//TODO: add potentialAlteredPoints and update + re-save it before generation (to make it robust enough to handle server crashes)

//TODO: onProtect, if (block is solid || glass) change block to bedrock for a second then back to original material
//do above idea with bedrock instead of below idea with particles
//MAYBE MVP?: make generation display wave of particle to indicate generating wall blocks
//	onGenerateBlock, show particles appearing for a few seconds at random points on all faces not touching solid block
//		maybe use nether particle but make the nether particle be drawn toward block (like the particles are drawn to nether portal)

//maybe finish writing version of manual that includes all planned features before actually releasing MVP (just so I've thought it all out)

// --- --- ---

//TODO: consider adding flag block/item to make generate/degenerate animation run faster




//teams:
//on base white list sign created, prompt named player(s) not already on team to type '/fort join [teamColor]'
//if unallied player on base white list tries to open protected door, cancel event and prompt to type '/fort join [teamColor]'
//after joining, player remains teamed until joining another team or typing '/fort leave'
//teamed players can't damage each other
//for each player in a team
//	if a non team/ally player is within 16 blocks of player
//		if player is moving
//			display colored particles around player's feet (color based on dye in fortress chest)

//team color and allies is based on fuel chest contents:
//first dye: selects team color
//	allow multiple teams to be same color (differentiate teams by number of dye items in stack)
//	if someone else has already claimed that team color, tell player team color is taken
//		after 24 hours of not being on, generator's team color is unclaimed
//	if no valid team color indicated, team particles are both white and black (interspersed)
//	replace generator's running indicator particles with team particles
//other dyes: allies you with other team(s) if alliance is mutual
//	while allied, enchant dye item with Protection I (remove enchant if removed from chest)
//quartz item: ignore white listed names not also on generator's base.
//	that way removing someone from base white list signs is an effective way to kick from team
//		make doors with white list sign(s) but no valid names fall back to base white list signs

//TODO: maybe: if player carries compass then instead of team color particles they see green/yellow/red for team/ally/other
//maybe if player carries clock show team particles even if players are not moving (except self)
//i think ParticleEffects already handles player specific particles but not certain

//commands:
/*

/fort list (display team members starting with owner)
/fort leave

//TODO: consider making Point immutable (final)
//TODO: refactor to use the listener pattern?

/* New Feature:
make pistons transmit generation when extended
    this will serve as a switch to allow nearby buildings to connect/disconnect from fortress generation
    pistons should have particle to indicate when the piston has been found by a fortress generator (onGeneratorStart searches)
    pistons should not be protected (breakable)
//*/

/*
pistonCores should respect even its parent generator's claims
pistonCores should respect other pistonCores' claims
	other generatorCores' claimed points including their pistonCores' claims and also any other pistonCores belonging to parent generator
pistonCore's wallMaterials should be based on parent generator's wallMaterials

on piston added to claimedWallPoints:
	create new PistonCore
on piston removed from claimedWallPoints:
	break pistonCore
on generator broken:
	break all its pistonCores

pistonCore:
	onExtend:
		if (parent generator is running)
			if (piston protected || piston extended to touch protected) tell pistonCore to generate
	onRetract:
		tell pistonCore to degenerate

generatorCore:
	onProtectPiston, onProtectPistonExtensionTouchPoint:
		set pistonCore.layerIndex
		if (extended) tell pistonCore to generate
	onGenerate:
		for each pistonCore
			if (pistonCore is protected)
				tell pistonCore to generate
	onDegenerate:
		include child pistonCores' generated
			use pistonCore.layerIndex to merge piston's generated with generator's generated

maybe instead of requiring piston be protected before it can work as a mini generator just require that a pistonCore has been created
	also create pistonCore if block piston is extended to touch is generated
